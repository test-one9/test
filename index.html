<h2>Local Privilege Escalation in OpenBSD's dynamic loader (CVE-2019-19726)</h2>

<div class="content">
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>We discovered a Local Privilege Escalation in OpenBSD's dynamic loader (ld.so): this vulnerability is exploitable in the default installation (via the set-user-ID executable chpass or passwd) and yields full root privileges.</p>
  <p>We developed a simple proof of concept and successfully tested it against OpenBSD 6.6 (the current release), 6.5, 6.2, and 6.1, on both amd64 and i386; other releases and architectures are probably also exploitable.</p>
